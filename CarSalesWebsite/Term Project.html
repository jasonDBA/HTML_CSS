			<h2>About Kia</h2>
			<p>From its very humble beginnings as a manufacturer of bicycle 
			parts by hand on the outskirts of Seoul, Korea, Kia Motors has 
			emerged as the driving force behind the Korean motor vehicle for the 
			last six decades, laying claim to the production of the country’s 
			first automobile as well as Korea’s first automobile export.</p>
			<p>The word “Kia” is derived from the Chinese characters Ki, meaning 
			to “arise or come up out of” and A, referring to Asia. So when put 
			together, Kia means to “arise or come up out of Asia”. Today, Kia 
			has truly risen as a major global player and boasts an 
			ever-expanding product line-up that is sold through a network of 
			distributors and dealers covering 172 countries around the world. 
			Kia Motors employs more than 40,000 individuals spanning the globe 
			from an expansive personnel network that each aspire for excellence 
			on behalf of our valued customers.</p>
